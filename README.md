# Explodium Breathing Engines
Modified jet engines, explodium vapour intakes, and oxidizer tanks for Kerbal Space Program's planet Eve. Also includes Resources definitions for "ExpVapour" (Explodium Vapour) and "ExlVapor" (Explosium Light Gas) , which should be found in certain atmospheres only. Intended as a jet engine counterpart to OhioBob's Eve Optimized Engines.

These are configuration files only, no software. MIT License similar to OhioBob's part pack.

Engine specific impulse is 45% of the originals for ExV, and about 35% of the originals for ExL, to reflect needing more OX and ExV to get the same amount of energy as the original engines based on an oxygen-RP1 reaction, while maintaining the original thrust. The Wiki explains the chemistry and engineering involved, and they could use further tuning.

Visible engine plumes replaced with blue plumes where appropriate, to match methane / ethane reactions with oxygen. RealPlume configurations are available if you have RealPlume Stock and SmokeScreen 2.7.4 installed. Waterfall configurations are available if you have the Waterfall engine plume plugin.
